    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the year, I was an unexperienced coder who didn't even know what a class was. As I worked with my team to finish tasks that wem struggled with, I built a strong foundation for coding. I learned how to set up my computer for CSSE, use AI as a learning resource to complete hacks and games, and work together with my team to finish a whole game that turned into a major success through thne hard work of the whole class. Although there is no doubt that I will struggle with coding in the future, with the help of my independency,s AI, and my team, I believe I can overcome any obstacle that gets thrown in my path. \n",

    "N@tM: Night at the Museum was one very unique and eye opening experience for me. My team worked relentlessly around the clock to mke sure our game was complete on time. We ran into so many issues, and argued with each other, but in the end we came together to solve all of our problems. This proccess really showed me how important having a good team and that relying too much on ai or your own knowledge can lead to your downfall. at N@tM, I was so nervous that something might go wrong with our game, but everything worked out great. Our presentation went smoothly and people seemed to like our game and how we developed it. The feedback we got really helped as well for improvement in the future. \n",

    "Next Project: For our next project, I would like to base it off our foundation of games, but shift the focus into benefiting our world. For example, each team could tackle a problem that affects people's lives accross the globe. The problems don't have to be major, they just have to affect everyday life. We can develop programs as solutions for these problems such as programmi ng beach cleanup robots. Converting our knowledge of Javascript, we can even create websites that show how we are helping society with technology and develop fun games and trivias for the audience.\n",

    "Want to Learn Next: I want to learn how to program. Wev'e programmed a big game recently, but I want to go further. I want to be able to programm things that take a physical effect, such as robots. Learning the code for the various functions sounds exciting and a diverese experience. We can use our knowledge to push ourselves even further\n",
