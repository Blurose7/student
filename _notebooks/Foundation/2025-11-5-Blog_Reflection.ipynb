    "## Begining of the Year\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the year, I was an unexperienced coder who didn't even know what a class was. As I worked with my team to finish tasks that wem struggled with, I built a strong foundation for coding. I learned how to set up my computer for CSSE, use AI as a learning resource to complete hacks and games, and work together with my team to finish a whole game that turned into a major success through thne hard work of the whole class. Although there is no doubt that I will struggle with coding in the future, with the help of my independency,s AI, and my team, I believe I can overcome any obstacle that gets thrown in my path. \n",

    "## Sprint 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint 1 was all about setting up my computer for CSSE. it showed me how to manage Vscode and Github. I also learned how to deploy on both localhost and github. Even settibng up the tools was hard, but it taught us to not give up and depend on others when facing a problem. You had to try any way possible to get your desired output. It was a compltley new experience for me and opened my eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sprint 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint 2 was all about making presentations and building our foundation of coding. Using different omponents in coding such as iterations, classes, and booleans, we created educational presentations that helped us and our audience learn so much about the components. Through decribing, making popcorn hacks, and making the homework, we built independency.\n",
    "## Sprint 3: \n",
    "\n",
    "Sprint 3 was a real challenge. It taught us to work as a team and especially to have a good work ethic. Without it, we would be letting our teamates down. Making the whole game for N@tM was stressful, but important as it showed us a real life experience. Working together, no matter how skilled you were in coding was incredibly important, adn in the end, through the struggles and problems we faced along the way, we finally finished. Our game was a huge success and working together as a class was a new and fascinating experience.\n"

    "\n",
    "N@tM: Night at the Museum was one very unique and eye opening experience for me. My team worked relentlessly around the clock to mke sure our game was complete on time. We ran into so many issues, and argued with each other, but in the end we came together to solve all of our problems. This proccess really showed me how important having a good team and that relying too much on ai or your own knowledge can lead to your downfall. at N@tM, I was so nervous that something might go wrong with our game, but everything worked out great. Our presentation went smoothly and people seemed to like our game and how we developed it. The feedback we got really helped as well for improvement in the future. \n",

    "## Next Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Project: For our next project, I would like to base it off our foundation of games, but shift the focus into benefiting our world. For example, each team could tackle a problem that affects people's lives accross the globe. The problems don't have to be major, they just have to affect everyday life. We can develop programs as solutions for these problems such as programmi ng beach cleanup robots. Converting our knowledge of Javascript, we can even create websites that show how we are helping society with technology and develop fun games and trivias for the audience.\n",

    "## What to do Next\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to Learn Next: I want to learn how to program. Wev'e programmed a big game recently, but I want to go further. I want to be able to programm things that take a physical effect, such as robots. Learning the code for the various functions sounds exciting and a diverese experience. We can use our knowledge to push ourselves even further\n",
